## Description
```

This web app is designed to keep a list of video games that a person owns.  
I am using localdb as the database to store the items in the collection and 
they are displayed on the home page sorted and displayed by which console
the game is owned on.
I am using Bootstrap for most of the web apps layout but it does have a little
custom css to fix some things I didn't like

```

To run this app, Download the repository and open in Visual Studio on the /home/index view. 
Click run.
